Report on the Modeling Process of Three Recommendation Algorithms

This report details the modeling process, including data preprocessing, implementation, and performance evaluation of three recommendation algorithms: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and a Hybrid Model.

1. Collaborative Filtering

Data Preparation:
-User-Item Interaction Matrix: 
  - Created by pivoting the dataset where rows represent users, columns represent items (movies), and values represent ratings.

Model Implementation:
- Matrix Factorization (Using TensorFlow):
  - Variables: Initialized latent features for users (`W`) and items (`X`) and bias term (`b`).
  - Optimization: Used Adam optimizer to minimize the loss function.
  - Regularization: Applied L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - Training: Implemented K-Fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.

Performance Metrics:
- Average R² Score across folds:0.8011
- Average RMSE across folds:0.5043
- Average MAE across folds:0.3623

Interpretation:
- The model explains 80.11% of the variance in the ratings, showing strong predictive power. The RMSE and MAE values are reasonably low, reflecting accurate predictions.

2.Content-Based Filtering

Data Preparation:
- Feature Extraction: 
  - Extracted features from items, including genres and release year.
  - Encoded categorical features (e.g., genres) and normalized numerical features (e.g., release year).

Model Implementation:
- Cosine Similarity:
  - Computed similarity between items based on their features.
- User Profile:
  - Constructed user profiles based on the items they have interacted with.

Performance Metrics:
- R² Score:-0.0322
- RMSE:1.1502
- MAE:0.8751

Interpretation:
- The content-based model performed poorly, indicated by a negative R² score and high RMSE and MAE values. This suggests the model struggles to capture the variance in the ratings and makes inaccurate predictions.

3.Hybrid Model

Data Preparation:
- Combining Features:
  - Integrated the collaborative and content-based features.
- Matrix Factorization and Cosine Similarity:
  - Performed SVD for collaborative filtering and computed cosine similarity for content-based filtering.

Model Implementation:
- Weighted Hybrid Approach:
  - Combined predictions from both models using a weighted sum.

Performance Metrics:
- Hybrid R² Score:-1.9384
- **Hybrid RMSE:1.9408
- **Hybrid MAE:1.6931

Interpretation:
- The hybrid model exhibited significant issues, as indicated by the highly negative R² score and high error metrics. This suggests a problem with the integration and weighting of the two models.
